# The A-maze-ing Race Project 2023
## Introduction
In the first semester of Year 1, as part of the CG1111A module, our team undertook the mBot robot finale project known as "The A-maze-ing Race." The primary objective was to design and construct an mBot robot capable of efficiently navigating a maze within the shortest possible time.

The maze presented challenges in the form of colored tiles, indicating the next direction for the robot. These tiles came in various colors, namely red, orange, green, blue, and purple. Each color instructed the robot to perform a specific type of turn to successfully traverse the maze.

The maze featured walls that the robot had to avoid while moving towards the waypoint challenges, signified by black strips on the floor. These challenges required the robot to execute turns based on the color of the tile, adding complexity to the navigation process.
